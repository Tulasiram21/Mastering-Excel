# My Excel Learning Journey ðŸ“Š  

This repository documents my progress in learning **Microsoft Excel** step by step.  
It includes both **learning lessons** and **practical projects** to strengthen my skills.

## Demonstrated Skills  

This work highlights my ability to:  

* **Format Data Professionally**  
  - Applied cell borders, alignment, and number formatting (currency, percentages, decimals).  
  - Improved readability and presentation of numerical data.  

* **Perform Basic Calculations**  
  - **Summation (`=SUM`)**: To calculate totals for a range of values.  
  - **Aggregation (`=ADD`)**: For straightforward addition.  
  - **Extremes (`=MIN`, `=MAX`)**: To identify the lowest and highest values in a dataset.  
  - **Averages (`=AVERAGE`)**: To compute the mean of a data series.  

* **Logical Functions**  
  - Applied the **`IF` function** to perform conditional calculations, such as awarding overtime bonuses only when overtime hours exceed a threshold.  
  - Learned **absolute referencing (`$A$1`)** for locking formulas when copying across rows and columns.  

* **Conditional Formatting**  
  - Practiced highlight rules (greater than, less than, text-based rules).  
  - Learned **Top/Bottom rules** to quickly identify standout values.  
  - Applied color scales and data bars for better visualization.  

* **Charts & Visualization**  
  - Practiced column charts to compare values.  
  - Adjusted chart orientation and labels for clear presentation.  

* **Decision-Making with Data**  
  - Built structured datasets (e.g., payrolls, career comparisons, gradebooks).  
  - Used formatting and formulas to support data-driven insights.

## Learning Outcomes  

- Practiced using **formulas** to calculate employee pay, averages, and totals.  
- Learned how to apply **summary functions** (MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, SUM).  
- Understood and applied the **IF function** for conditional logic.  
- Built payroll reports with **overtime calculations** and summary statistics.  
- Strengthened skills in **absolute references** for consistent formulas.  
- Practiced **conditional formatting** (highlight cell rules, Top/Bottom rules, scales).  
- Created **comparison datasets** (career decisions, gradebooks) to simulate real-world Excel tasks.  
- Gained confidence in using **charts and formatting** to make data easy to understand.

## Files  

- **[Work Hours Report](work_hours_report.xlsx)** â€“ My first Excel practice file. Includes basic payroll calculations using formulas like `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVERAGE`.  
- **[Employee Payroll Report](employee_payroll_report.xlsx)** â€“ Improved payroll sheet using the **IF function** to calculate overtime bonuses and total pay.  
- **[Employee Payroll with Overtime Analysis](employee_payroll_with_overtime.xlsx)** â€“ Extended payroll with summary statistics, including use of **absolute referencing** for formulas.  
- **[Gradebook](Grade_Book.xlsx)** â€“ Practice file with multiple test scores to learn **data entry** and formatting.  
- **[Career Decisions](Career_decisions.xlsx)** â€“ Dataset comparing jobs (pay, market, talent, schooling, enjoyment). Used **conditional formatting** with **Top/Bottom rules** and highlight rules for analysis.
