# My Excel Learning Journey ðŸ“Š

This repository documents my progress in learning **Microsoft Excel** step by step.  
It includes both **learning lessons** and **practical projects** to strengthen my skills.

## Demonstrated Skills

This work highlights my ability to:

* **Format Data Professionally**
  - Applied cell borders, alignment, and number formatting (currency, percentages, decimals).
  - Improved readability and presentation of numerical data.
  - Used **Wrap Text** and **Orientation** to make reports more professional.
  - Applied **Color Scales** for quick visual insights.

* **Perform Basic Calculations**
  - **Summation (`=SUM`)**: To calculate totals for a range of values.
  - **Aggregation (`=ADD`)**: For straightforward addition.
  - **Extremes (`=MIN`, `=MAX`)**: To identify the lowest and highest values in a dataset.
  - **Averages (`=AVERAGE`)**: To compute the mean of a data series.
  - **Conditional Summing (`=SUMIF`)**: To sum values that meet a condition.

* **Logical Functions**
  - Applied the **`IF` function** to perform conditional calculations, such as awarding overtime bonuses only when overtime hours exceed a threshold.
  - Learned **absolute referencing (`$A$1`)** for locking formulas when copying across rows and columns.
  - Practiced **OR condition** to handle multiple logical checks.

* **Lookup & Text Functions**
  - Learned **`VLOOKUP`** to fetch data from related tables.
  - Used **`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`** to extract parts of text.
  - Practiced **`CONCATENATE`** (or `&`) to combine text from multiple cells.

* **Conditional Formatting**
  - Practiced highlight rules (greater than, less than, text-based rules).
  - Learned **Top/Bottom rules** to quickly identify standout values.
  - Applied **Color Scales** for better visualization.

* **Charts & Visualization**
  - Practiced column charts to compare values.
  - Learned **Scatter Charts** to visualize relationships between two variables.
  - Adjusted chart orientation, labels, and legends for clear presentation.

* **Data Handling**
  - Used **Text to Columns** to split data into multiple fields.
  - Practiced **Sorting & Filtering** to organize and extract meaningful records.

* **Pivot Tables**
  - Built **Pivot Tables** to summarize data.
  - Learned to group, filter, and calculate totals in pivot views.

* **Decision-Making with Data**
  - Built structured datasets (e.g., payrolls, career comparisons, gradebooks).
  - Used formatting and formulas to support data-driven insights.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practiced using **formulas** to calculate employee pay, averages, and totals.
- Learned how to apply **summary functions** (MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, SUM) and **conditional summing (SUMIF)**.
- Understood and applied the **IF function** and **OR condition** for conditional logic.
- Built payroll reports with **overtime calculations** and summary statistics.
- Strengthened skills in **absolute references** for consistent formulas.
- Practiced **conditional formatting** (highlight cell rules, Top/Bottom rules, Color Scales).
- Learned to use **Text functions** (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`, `CONCATENATE`,`VALUE`) and **VLOOKUP**.
- Created **Scatter Charts** to analyze variable relationships.
- Created **comparison datasets** (career decisions, gradebooks) to simulate real-world Excel tasks.
- Learned to use **Text to Columns, Sorting, and Filtering** to clean and analyze data.
- Built **Pivot Tables** for advanced data summarization.
- Gained confidence in using **charts and formatting** to make data easy to understand.
