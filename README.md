### Demonstrated Skills

This work highlights my ability to:

* **Format Data Professionally**: Applied cell borders and used **currency formatting** to improve readability of numerical data.  
* **Perform Basic Calculations**: Utilized essential formulas to summarize and analyze data, including:  
  * **Summation (`=SUM`)**: To calculate totals for a range of values.  
  * **Aggregation (`=ADD`)**: For straightforward addition.  
  * **Extremes (`=MIN`, `=MAX`)**: To identify the lowest and highest values in a dataset.  
  * **Averages (`=AVERAGE`)**: To compute the mean of a data series.  
* **Logical Functions**: I Applied the **`IF` function** to perform conditional calculations, such as determining overtime bonuses only when overtime hours are greater than six.
